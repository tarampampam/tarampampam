### Senior Go developer, Solution Architect

My name is Nikolai, and I have been professionally developing software for over 8 years.

I possess extensive expertise in **Go**, **containerization**, as well as best practices for developing **scalable** and **fail-safe** applications. Additionally, I have broad experience in deploying **infrastructure** as code (IaC). I have played key roles in developing distributed systems architectures across various projects. Furthermore, I am proficient in PHP and capable of developing simple projects using C, C++, and NodeJS.

While my English proficiency is at a B1 (Intermediate) level, I have more experience in written communication than verbal.

I have experience in **team management** and establishing processes for interdepartmental collaboration within a company.
