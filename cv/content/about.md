### Senior Go developer, Solution Architect

My name is Nikolai and I have been developing software professionally for 8+ years.

I have deep expertise in **Go**, **containerization**, and **scalable** and **fail-safe** application development best practices. In addition, I have broad experience in **infrastructure** as code (IaC) deployment. I played key roles in developing distributed systems **architecture development** on various projects. Furthermore, I am proficient in PHP and can also develop simple projects using C, C++, and NodeJS.

My level of English is B1 (Intermediate), but I have much more experience in writing than in verbal communication.

I have experience **managing teams** and building processes of interaction between different units in a company.
