- I played a key role in rewriting a media content processing service (similar to YouTube) using Go and Temporal instead of the old one written in Go/PHP and SWF; this led to a reduction in video processing time and the cost of cloud infrastructure
- Developed the frontend part (admin panel) for it in ReactJS (the prototype was developed in VueJS)
- Optimized the application build and delivery process by migrating it to Docker and GitLab CI/CD
- Participated in the development of Terraform Runbooks for infrastructure deployments to AWS
- Conducted code reviews and assisted colleagues in solving complex architectural problems
