- Developed changes tracking service (and then streaming via GRPC) in the state of the blockchain, which reduced the cost of data processing 4 times while removing the bottleneck of the product’s horizontal scaling.
- Developed a dynamic proxying service that independently searches for the best proxy servers and is very ascetic about the resources it consumes
- Designed and deployed from scratch (using Ansible) a fault-tolerant infrastructure on HashiStack (Consul, Nomad) with monitoring and logging (Prometheus, Promtail, Loki, Grafana) and the ability to be present in different geographic zones
- Built CI/CD processes in the company (testing, build, and delivery) for Go and NodeJS applications
- Interviewed candidates for the position of DevOps engineers
