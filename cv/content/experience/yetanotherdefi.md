- Developed a changes tracking service that utilizes GRPC for streaming the state of the blockchain. This implementation resulted in a 4-fold reduction in data processing costs while eliminating the bottleneck that hindered the horizontal scaling of the product
- Created a dynamic proxying service that autonomously searches for the most optimal proxy servers, ensuring minimal resource consumption
- Designed and deployed a fault-tolerant infrastructure from the ground up, using Ansible, on HashiStack (Consul, Nomad). This infrastructure includes comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities with Prometheus, Promtail, Loki, and Grafana, allowing presence in different geographic zones
- Implemented CI/CD processes for Go and NodeJS applications within the company, covering testing, building, and delivery stages
- Conducted interviews for DevOps engineer positions
