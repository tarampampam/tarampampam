- Developed a pipeline for generating vehicle history reports. This involved extracting information from various sources with different priorities, as well as data validation

- Designed the architecture for future services, including infrastructure requirements, communication protocols, and fault tolerance measures
- Transitioned all development processes from local environments to Docker, significantly simplifying application deployment and operation
- Implemented CI/CD processes within the company for testing, building, and delivering Python, Go, NodeJS, and PHP applications
- Ensured the smooth operation of services in production, continuously enhancing their observability and fault tolerance
