- Developed a pipeline for generating vehicle history reports (it extracts information from various sources with different priorities, data validity, and so on)
- Developed a language-agnostic botnet for Google reCaptcha bypassing (analog of `anti-captcha.com`), which reduced data mining costs by 60% and improved stability
- Developed the architecture of future services (infrastructure requirements, communication protocols, fault tolerance, etc.)
- Moved all development from the local environment to Docker, making it much easier to run and operate applications
- Built CI/CD processes in the company (testing, building, and delivery) for Python, Go, NodeJS, and PHP applications
- Maintained services in production, constantly improving their observability and fault tolerance

Also, I was involved in planning and management:

- Made code review a mandatory development step
- Organized training for developers, held seminars and meetups
- Interviewed candidates and formed teams
- Organized workflows, planned sprints and tasks using YouTrack
- Managed a development team (6+ people), including conflict resolution within the team
- Created an RnD team that was dedicated to solving unsolvable problems
